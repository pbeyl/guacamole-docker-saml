Prerequisites
-------------
* An Ubuntu Linux VM with docker and docker-composed pre-installed
* Netskope Private access publisher deployed and configured
* A browser based app configured for the guacamole VM host port 8433
* Netskope private access Reverse Proxy idP SAML Configuration
* Guacamole app idP SAML configuration 

Config Steps
-----
Copy guacamole-docker-saml.tar.gz to Ubuntu VM home folder and extract
```
# tar -zxvf guacamole-docker-saml.tar.gz
# cd guacamole-docker-saml
```

Run the configuration script and capture all the required information
```
# ./configure.sh
```
When requested to enter the admin account, specify the administrative user account that needs to be created as the initial administrative account on Guacamole. This needs to be a valid account on the idP which is assigned to the guacamole SAML app.
```
Enter admin account [admin@example.onmicrosoft.com]: 
```
Next enter the url for the browser based app configured as a browser based private app. The browser based app definition needs to point to the host you are currently installing guacamole on. Remember to define the publisher that has tcp access to this hosy and add a real time policy to allow access to this application.
```
Enter Netskope App URL [example: https://app-8443-tenant.eu.npaproxy.goskope.com]: 
```
When the guacamole service starts it will listen on port 8433 with the self signed certificate generated by this configure script.
Certificates are installed in .nginx/ssl/ and can be replaced by trusted CA signed certs if desired.

When prompted to provide the SAML Login URL, provide the URL associated to the SAML configuration for the Guacamole app. 
```
Enter SAML IDP Login URL:
```

Lastly, input the meta data url associated with the guacamole app SAML configuration and confirm the configuration to complete the setup.
```
Enter SAML Metadata URL:
```

The final step in the script is to save the configuration to the .env file and start the required docker container. 
```
- Writing config to .env -
Completed writing config variables to .env
Creating network "guacamole-docker-saml_guacnetwork" with driver "bridge"
Creating guacd              ... done
Creating postgres_guacamole ... done
Creating guacamole          ... done
Creating nginx_guacamole    ... done
```

There are four docker containers started. Postgresql is used for all configuration related to the guacamole installation, nginx exposes the application to the network and provides TLS encryption, guacamole is the HTML5 guacamole client and guacd is the guacamole service providing access to the RDP, VNC and SSH services. 

You can validate that all containers is running
```
# docker ps
